The classic Linux way of doing this sort of thing goes something like this:

    Create the shared folder:

    sudo mkdir /home/Shared

    Create the new user's group:

    sudo addgroup newgroup

    Change ownership of the shared folder to the new group:

    sudo chown :newgroup /home/Shared

    Add your desired users to that group:

    sudo adduser user1 newgroup

Repeat for all users.

Now you have some decisions to make about what you want those users to be able to do:

    [a] All group users can add to and delete from the folder and can read and but not write to each others files:

    sudo chmod 0770 /home/Shared

    [b] Same as above but only the owner of the file can delete it:

    sudo chmod 1770 /home/Shared

    [c] All group users can add to and delete from the folder and can read and write to each other's files:

    sudo chmod 2770 /home/Shared

    [d] Same as [c] except only the owner of the file can delete it:

    sudo chmod 3770 /home/Shared

A 1 in the first position of the chmod command is the sticky bit which prevents deletion of a file to anyone other than the owner.

A 2 in the first position of the chmod command is the setgid bit which forces all new or copied files to have the group of that folder.

A 3 in the first position of the chmod command is the combination of the sticky (1) & setgid (+2) bits.
